# Symfony 4 Internals

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2018 Presentation by Tobias Nyholm

Symfony is a request and response framework. But what about all that magic that happens around your code? Why isnâ€™t autowiring slowing things down? And how is it that Symfony components can be so decoupled but sill play so well together?

I will show you the Symfony internals and its architecture.

This talk will go over the architecture of Symfony. We will follow the request and the response paths throw the framework. We will do some stops at the components that are more awesome than others.

This talk is perfect for you who is working with Symfony or Laravel and want to understand what the framework actually is doing for you.
