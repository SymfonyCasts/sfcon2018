# Building Global Web Apps with Multi-region Hosting

by Jordi Boggiano

This session will explore various setups and case studies from my attempts at hosting sites used by global audiences.

There are many ways this can be achieved with different levels of success, budgets and global-ness.

The talk will touch on Terraform, AWS, global DNS resolution and CDNs amongst other things.
