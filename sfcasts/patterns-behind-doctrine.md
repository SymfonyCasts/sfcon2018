# The Patterns Behind Doctrine

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2018 Presentation by Denis Brumann

How does Doctrine talk to your database? What are Data Mapper, Unit Of Work, and Identity Map? These are the questions I want to answer in this talk. We will look at how Doctrine ORM implements them and what they are there for. Finally we will look at how they compare to Active Record and what the benefits and drawbacks are to help you choose which one fits your needs best.
