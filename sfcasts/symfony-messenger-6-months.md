# Symfony Messenger: 6 months already and more to come

***TIP
SymfonyCon 2018 Presentation by [Samuel Roze](https://github.com/sroze) 
The Messenger component brings asynchronous processing to Symfony: using message bus(es) you are able to decouple your application and route some (or all) of these "messages" to transports such as the built-in AMQP transport. It’s been more than 6 months since we’ve merged the new Messenger component in Symfony. We will explore the different use cases it has been used for so far and how it will continue to involve in order to facilitate even more.
