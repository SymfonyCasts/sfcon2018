by Pedro Magalh√£es

PHP releases a new minor version every year. Major versions happen when there are enough changes that justify to do so. Who is making those changes and how does that process work? What is the process to get an RFC to vote and the subsequent merge of the code? How can I make my first contribution? Is there anything I can do even if I don't know C? If you are intrigued by PHP internals, this talk is for you.
