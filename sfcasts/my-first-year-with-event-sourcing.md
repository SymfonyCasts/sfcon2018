# My first year with event sourcing (in Symfony)

by Tim Huijzers

Over the last couple of years, I have heard of Event sourcing but didn't really know where to start until I did a tutorial at DPC '17. After having some basic information it was time to start a Hackathon and after that something production worty. In this talk I will try to give the best information to get started and to know some of the problems you can face if you begin event-sourcing.
